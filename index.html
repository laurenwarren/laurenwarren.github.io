                <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Born and raised in North Louisiana, I have been interested in creative hobbies and jobs since kindergarten. I studied graphic design in undergrad at Louisiana Tech and taught myself photography. I was a Production Designer at Romph•Pou Agency after University, but have been solely freelancing for the past year. These experiences brought me perspectives and skills that are still useful to me as a Product Designer. My mission has always been to provide help by understanding needs. By now, I have learned so many skills to do just that.</p>

                <h3>CURRENTLY</h3>
                <br>
                <p>After giving birth to our twin girls in April of 2020, I decided to dedicate my time to growing our creative freelance business, and that has since become my full-time job. I am now looking to switch to a stable, full-time UXUI job.</p>

                <h3>INFP | LIBRA | TYPE 9</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I totally agree with my personality types’ descriptions! To sum it all up, they claim I’m compassionate, a helper, idealist, organized, and both emotional and logical. I see patterns and possibilities everywhere, and prioritize people (but can be a bit of a workaholic too). I prefer structure and order, but that includes balance in my life and the lives of those around me. I’ve been know to play peacemaker and go out of my way to improve the lives of those around me.</p>

                <h3>I'M FOND OF</h3>
                <br>
                <p>nurturing the relationships in my life, especially of my cute little family and friends, as well as building new relationships.</p>

                <h3>FUN FACT</h3>
                <br>
                <p>if I had to go back in time and choose a completely different career track, I’d choose to be a primate zookeeper. I’m entralled with animals, especially those with amazing abilities to communicate (and not just our two pups).</p>
